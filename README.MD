#### Examples of the implementation and analysis of the performance of sorting algorithms:

- Bubble sorting;
- Coctail sorting;
- Insertion sorting;
- Gnome sorting;
- Merge sorting;
- Quick sorting;

#### Performance analysis is performed by measuring the execution time of the algorithm when applying to the input an array of 10,000 integers.
